		Objective: 		    To Demonstrate 
                            1. how to design an adder with verilog RTL coding style
                            2. how to verify this adder with an Verilog testbench
                            3. how to invoke the simulator to check the result with the waveform
		Description: 	 	The example shows how to invoke VCS and run a simple verilog file. 
 
 To run the example:
      Using Makefile:
       	compile             -- To compile the design
        simulate            -- To simulate the design
        run                 -- It does all the above steps.
       	clean               -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
     Using shell scripts:
        clean.csh           -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
        com.csh             -- To compile the design
        run.csh             -- To run the design
